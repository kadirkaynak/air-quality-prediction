# Air Quality Prediction
BLG556E - Digital Solution for Smart Cities (AirQualityPrediction)

**_WARNING:_** Project is still under construction.

Base implementation for the GCN-LSTM architecture which is inspired from the paper [T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8809901) can be found in this [link](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demos/time-series/gcn-lstm-time-series.html). Link utilizes LSTM instead of GRU layer, and additional Dropout and Dense layers different from the original paper.
