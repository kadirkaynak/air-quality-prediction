    """
    GCN_LSTM is a univariate timeseries forecasting method. The architecture  comprises of a stack of N1 Graph Convolutional layers followed by N2 LSTM layers, a Dropout layer, and  a Dense layer.
    This main components of GNN architecture is inspired by: T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05320).
    The implementation of the above paper is based on one graph convolution layer stacked with a GRU layer.

    The StellarGraph implementation is built as a stack of the following set of layers:

    1. User specified no. of Graph Convolutional layers
    2. User specified no. of LSTM layers
    3. 1 Dense layer
    4. 1 Dropout layer.

    The last two layers consistently showed better performance and regularization experimentally.
